# Introduction

This is an example R Markdown file that is used for the OSCoffee meeting. In this document you can find some basic R Markdown syntax and code. I encourage you to use these type of documents for your own research reports.

Code for this document can be found on [Github](https://github.com/jeffreydurieux/OSCoffee_RMarkdown)

In this example [cluster analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) is performed on the famous [iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). Cluster analysis is an exploratory data analysis technique that enables a grouping of objects (flowers in this example) in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than objects in other groups.

# Data inspection

In this \texttt{R} code chunk below the iris data set is loaded and attached in R. The structure of the data is shown, together with the first view objects of the data set.

There are 150 flowers, 3 species measures on 4 variables.

```{r datainspection, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
df <- iris
str(df)
head(df)
table(df$Species)
```

A basic R plot, the different colors refer to the different flower species

```{r basicplot, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
plot(df[,-5], col = df$Species, main = 'Plot of iris data set')
```

# Cluster analysis

## k-means

K-means cluster analysis using the algorithm from @HartiganWong1979 is perfomed on the iris data set without the species labels. We select for three clusters (K = 3) and compare the results with the actual species label

```{r kmeans, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
set.seed(42)
km <- kmeans(x = df[,-5] , centers = 3, nstart = 1000)
km
```

Here is a comparison of the estimated cluster labels and the true labels. A cross tabulation is shown together with the adjusted Rand index [@Hubert1985] from the mclust package [@mclust]. A value around zero means that the estimated clustering does not correspond to the actual labels. A value of 1 means a perfect cluster retrieval.

```{r kmeanscomparison, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mclust))
addmargins( table( iris$Species, km$cluster))

adjustedRandIndex(iris$Species, km$cluster)
```

## Fuzzy c-means

K-means is a hard partitioning clustering method. That means that object are only allowed to belong to one cluster. We can relax that assumption by using a fuzzy or soft clustering procedure. A famous procedure that enables fuzzy clustering is known as fuzzy c-means [@Bezdek1984]. Code for fuzzy c-means can be found in the R package e1071 [@e1071].

Fuzzy c-means is performed selecting for 3 clusters and using a fuzziness parameter of m = 2. The closest cluster memberships are shown below

```{r cmeans, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(e1071))

# play around with m to change the fuzziness/softness of the clustering
# hard partitioning --> 1.1, soft clustering --> pick a higher number e.g., 2

cm <- cmeans(x = df[,-5], centers = 3, m = 2)
cm$cluster

```

\newpage

A cross tabulation of the results and adjusted Rand index:
  
```{r fkmeanscomparison, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mclust))
addmargins( table( iris$Species, cm$cluster))

adjustedRandIndex(iris$Species, cm$cluster)
```

A plot is show below. Since this is a pdf document, no interactive plots can be shown. This is however possible in a html document. In order to make the plotly plots static, the webshot package [@webshot] should be installed. function is used. This function is present in the plotly package [@plotly]

```{r plotly2d, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# run code below first in console
# install webshot for static image --> install.packages("webshot")
# webshot::install_phantomjs()
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
dff <- data.frame(iris[,-5], lab = as.factor( cm$cluster), 
                  fuzzy = round(apply(cm$membership, MARGIN = 1, max),3))


#hover over data points to see the fuzziness of the clustering
p <- dff %>% plot_ly(x=~Sepal.Length,y=~Sepal.Width, color = ~lab, text = ~fuzzy)
tmpfile <- tempfile(fileext = '.png')
export(p , file = tmpfile)
# this code outside R code chunck ![](`r tmpfile`)
```

# An example t-test

Besides including pretty plots and figures, you can also use reproducible documents to update and report your results in-text.
Imagine, we just finished our analysis of whether Setosa petals and Versicolors have significantly different petal lengths:

```{r sepallength, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
N <- dim(df)[1] # sample size

my_results <- t.test(df$Petal.Length[df$Species=="setosa"], df$Petal.Length[df$Species=="versicolor"]) # save results as object

str(my_results) # see how to access values you want to report

```

<!---
 Let's report our results as R-objects:
--->

> We collected `r N` petals and compared the sepal lengths of Setosas (N = `r dim(df[df$Species=="setosa", ])[1]`) and Versicolors (N = `r dim(df[df$Species=="versicolor", ])[1]`). The length of Setosa petals (M = `r  round(my_results$estimate[1], 2)`) was super-duper significantly different from that of Versicolors (M = `r  round(my_results$estimate[2], 2)`), *t* = `r round(my_results$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* = `r my_results$p.value`.

While we patiently wrote down our results, a wind gust blew away part of the petals. Luckily, we can now report the updated results by simply copy-pasting the above text! 

```{r updatedSepallength, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
temp <- sample(1:N, size = 0.5*N) # let's assume wind will away half of our petals at random
df <- df[temp, ]; rm(temp) # now they are gone 

N <- dim(df)[1] # new sample size
my_results <- t.test(df$Petal.Length[df$Species=="setosa"], df$Petal.Length[df$Species=="versicolor"]) # new results

```

 The following results text is just copied from above
